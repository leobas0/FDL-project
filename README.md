# Foundations of Deep Learning course project

Group members: Leonardo Basili, Léopold Granger

## Introduction

The project consisted in a kaggle challenge focused on the development of a dense segmentation model for aerial post-flood aerial imagery.

## Background
A global rise in the occurrences of natural disasters and human-borne conflicts has put a spotlight on the need for Earth Observation (EO) data in designing practical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) interventions. Novel techniques that leverage remotely sensed data are leading to a paradigm shift in our understanding of such situations and improving the efficacy and timeliness of our response. Aerial post-flood maps can provide localized insight into the extent of flood-related damage and the degree to which communities’ access to shelter, clean water, and communication channels have been compromised. 

Unfortunately, such insights typically only emerge hours or days after a flooding event has occurred. Moreover, a scarcity of available historical data restricts the development of practical machine learning-based methods. However the latest applications of Computer Vision technique give the possibility to provide useful insights tempestively leveraging the latest deep learning models.

## Dataset
The Hurricane Harvey dataset contains several hundred drone images of residential neighborhoods in Houston. For each, a dense segmentation mask has been generated for the classes mentioned below. Each mask was further vectorized to provide additional representations for modeling, visualization, and review.
